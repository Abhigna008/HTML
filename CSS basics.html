<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> saves a lot of work. 
It can control the layout of multiple pages all at once.</p>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
</p>
<mark>Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

<pre>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <q>style element</q> in the <q>head</q> section
External - by using a <q>link element</q> to link to an external CSS file
</pre>
<h1>INLINE CSS</h1>
<p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the h3 element to blue, and the text color of the p element to red:</p>
<p> below is the example</p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">This is the heading</h3>
<p style="color:red;">This is the paragraph</p>
