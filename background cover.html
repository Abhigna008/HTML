<p>If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.<br>

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed<br>

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions)</p>
