    <div class="relative">THIS IS RELATIVE POSITIONING
      <div class="absolute">An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
        
        Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.

    <h1>OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS</h1>
    <p>When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

      The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
      
      An element can have a positive or negative stack order:

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.</p>
